What is TypeScript?
------------------
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to help developers write more reliable and maintainable 
code. It allows you to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values, which helps catch errors at compile time 
rather than runtime.

You can use TypeScript for web development (Angular, React, Vue.js), server-side with Node.js, cross-platform mobile apps (React Native), 
desktop apps (Electron), game development, backend services (Express.js, Nest.js), command-line tools, WebAssembly, IoT, browser extensions, 
web APIs, static site generators, educational projects, and open-source initiatives. It enhances JavaScript with static typing, improving 
code quality and tooling support.
