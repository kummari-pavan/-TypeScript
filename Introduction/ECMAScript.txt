ECMAScript:
-----------
ECMAScript (or ES) is like the blueprint for JavaScript and TypeScript. Think of it as a set of rules and guidelines that JavaScript 
(and by extension, TypeScript) follows to make sure it's working the same way everywhere.

how it works:
ECMAScript is the standard (the rules).
JavaScript is a language that follows this standard.

What does ECMAScript define?
----------------------------
It defines things like syntax (how you write code), data types (numbers, strings, etc.), functions, and objects.
Versions of ECMAScript:
----------------------
There are different versions, like ES5 and ES6 (also called ES2015), with newer features like let, const, arrow functions, and more.
TypeScript and ECMAScript:
-------------------------
TypeScript follows ECMAScript but adds extra features (like types) on top.
